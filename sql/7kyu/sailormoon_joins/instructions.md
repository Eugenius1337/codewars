Return a results table - sailor_senshi, real_name, cat and school - of all characters, containing each character's high school, their civilian name and the cat who introduced them to their magical crime-fighting destiny.

Keep in mind some senshi were not initiated by a cat guardian and one is not in high school. The field can be left blank if this is the case.
